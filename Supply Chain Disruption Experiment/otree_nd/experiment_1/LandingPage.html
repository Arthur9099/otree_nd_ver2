    <div class="landing-title">WELCOME TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN RISK MANAGEMENT EXPERIMENT</div>
    
    <div class="content-section">
        <p class="content-text">
            This game is an experiment about decision-making in supply chain risk management. The instructions are simple, and if you read them carefully and make good decisions, you could earn a considerable amount of money which will be paid to you in cash at the end of the experiment. To ensure that the instructions are clear and understandable, you are asked to answer a couple of multiple-choice questions on the next page. The real experiment will proceed once you complete all questions correctly. During the experiment, you are not allowed to make noise or talk to other participants. The first violation of this rule will result in a warning, and the second violation will result in immediate termination of participation; in this case, your earnings will be 0. If you have any questions during the experiment, please notify the instructor to receive the support needed.

            You will act as a <span class="highlight">general manager of an international firm</span>, serving mainly the European market. As your suppliers and manufacturing facilities are located in various countries around the world, they are constantly exposed to the uncertainty of disruption risk, which, in turn, will affect your business in case disruption happens. As a result, at the beginning of every quarter, equivalent to each round within the game, your task is to decide how much money to pour into <span class="highlight">SC contingencies risk management</span> (or building resilient SC), which helps to minimize the impact of SC disruption (e.g., Having sufficient safety stock, maintaining multiple suppliers...) and/or reduce the probability of SC disruption (e.g., Auditing and monitoring supplier, Reallocating manufacturing facilities out of high risk exposed countries...). If you decide not to invest or invest too little, you may incur costs related to SC disruptions (e.g., Due to foregone sales and future loss of customers to competitors...). On the other hand, if you invest too much in enforcing SC resilience, you will increase fixed costs due to excessive investment... The relationship between resilient SC investment and disruption is plotted in the line chart below, which is straightforward and intuitive.
